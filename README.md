## Step 0 - Initial Setup

1. Download [ARDUINO IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
2. Pair up as a team.
3. Make sure your team has one Arduino UNO board with USB cable and solderless breadboard.
4. Turn on Arduino IDE and move on to Step 1 !

## Step 1 - Introduction of Arduino

### 1.1 What is Arduino? Why Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs and turn it into an output. </br>
Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well.

### 1.2 Arduino integrated development environment (IDE)
In this workshop, we will be using the Arduino IDE to write code to program the Arduino board.
The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform application provides a text editor with the typical IDE
features like syntax highlighting, a compiler to compile and upload code to the board. </br>
A program written with the Arduino IDE is called a sketch. Sketches are saved on the
development computer as text files with the file extension ".ino". The Arduino IDE utilises C++
as its programming language and contains various libraries catered to the Arduino.
